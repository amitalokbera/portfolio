- Improved large video file uploads efficiency by 70% and reduced server load significantly by implementing presigned URLs
and multipart uploads to enable direct media file uploads to S3 (Cloudflare R2).
- Enhanced the upload process by integrating a WASM worker for client-side metadata extraction and thumbnail generation,
eliminating the need for server-side indexing and contributing to substantial processing speed gains.
- Developed an advanced video preview feature with a draggable slider for before/after upscaled video comparison, improving
user experience and increasing satisfaction ratings from 3.1 to 4.2.
- Developed a no-signup feature allowing users to upscale short video versions directly on our platform, which led to a 20%
increase in user sign-ups compared to the previous month.
- Established a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, leading to faster release cycles and improved application reliability
via automated testing and deployment.
