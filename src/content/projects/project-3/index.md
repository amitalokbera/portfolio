**What is TNSR.AI and why did I build it?**

TNSR.AI is a web-based platform that leverages deep learning models to enhance videos, audio, and images. I built it to make **AI-powered media restoration accessible and scalable**, combining real-time interactivity with production-grade cloud architecture.

## Key Features & Architecture

### Frontend  
- Built with **Next.js (TypeScript)** + **TailwindCSS**, designed for responsive performance.  
- Real-time job status updates using **WebSockets/Socket.io** for live processing feedback.  

### Backend  
- Powered by **FastAPI** with modular, clean architecture.  
- **Celery + Redis** for distributed job processing (long-running ML tasks, notifications, billing).  
- RESTful APIs with Pydantic validation, async I/O, and custom error handling.  

### Data & Storage  
- **PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy** with indexed relational models for jobs, users, and billing.  
- Media files stored on **Cloudflare R2** with signed URL uploads/downloads.  

### Authentication & Payments  
- **JWT with Google SSO** for authentication and secure sessions.  
- **Stripe integration** for subscriptions, invoices, and multi-currency billing.  

### Monitoring & Observability  
- **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing.  
- **Prometheus + Grafana + Loki** for metrics, dashboards, and log aggregation.  
- Sentry for error tracking and alerting.  

### DevOps & CI/CD  
- Fully containerized with **Docker**.  
- Automated pipelines with **GitHub Actions** for tests (Jest, Pytest, Cypress), builds, and deployments to Ubuntu servers.

## Scaling & Future Plans  

The system is designed for **horizontal scalability** with independently deployable components. Planned enhancements include:  
- Expanding support for additional AI/ML models.  
- Moving toward a **microservices-based architecture**.  
- Adding real-time collaboration features.  
- Providing an extended API for third-party integrations.
