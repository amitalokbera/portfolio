## Taking Control of My Data: Why I'm Building MediaVault

Ever feel a little uneasy about how much of your personal life resides on a handful of corporate servers? From family photos and videos to important documents, we entrust so much of our digital lives to services like Google Drive. While convenient, this often comes at the cost of our privacy. That's why I've started working on a new side project, and I'm excited to share it with you: **MediaVault**.

### What is MediaVault? üöÄ

MediaVault is an **open-source, full-stack web application** designed to give you complete control over your personal data. Think of it as a self-hosted alternative to Google Drive or Photos, but with a core focus on privacy and user ownership. You decide where and how your photos, videos, and documents are stored, without a tech giant peeking over your shoulder.

Beyond simple storage, I'm building MediaVault with a suite of modern features to make organizing and accessing your files intuitive and powerful, including:

* **Smart Tagging & Indexing:** Automatically categorize and search your media with intelligent tagging.
* **AI-Powered Chatbot:** Interact with your files in a conversational way to find what you need, fast.
* **You're in Control:** You have the final say on the storage infrastructure.

### My Journey with AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è

Another key motivation for this project is to dive deep into the world of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Building MediaVault from the ground up is the perfect opportunity to learn more about the vast ecosystem of services AWS offers. Each week, I'll be documenting my journey, sharing the challenges I face, the solutions I discover, and the insights I gain while architecting and deploying a real-world application.
